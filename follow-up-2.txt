Subject: Your voice matters in this conversation, {FIRST_NAME}

Hi {FIRST_NAME},

I wanted to reach out again because I believe your perspective could really enrich the conversations I'm having with other brilliant women navigating similar paths.

This is not about being interviewed in a formal sense — it's about sharing honestly, woman to woman, about the often unseen layers of striving, success, and seeking something deeper.

If it feels aligned, you can book a time to chat here:

Still offering coffee on me — and a meaningful exchange in return

Warmly,

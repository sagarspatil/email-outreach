    Hi {FIRST_NAME},

    I came across your LinkedIn profile while exploring women working in tech — and it's clear from your journey that you've carved out an inspiring path in a demanding field.

    I'm Shilpa, founder of a holistic wellness company based in the SF Bay Area. I'm currently working on a passion project that involves interviewing high-achieving women like you to have real, honest conversations around:

    * The weight of constantly being 'on' — for work, for family, for everything
    * The mental and emotional juggling act behind high performance  
    * The invisible toll success can take on our health, joy, and relationships

    There's no pitch or hidden agenda — just a genuine, heart-centered conversation between two women who've lived this and are exploring what a more sustainable version of success looks like.

    If this speaks to you, I'd love to connect and hear your story. You can book a time that works for you here:

    https://calendly.com/advayaholistic-9quk/30min?month=2025-05

    Warmly,

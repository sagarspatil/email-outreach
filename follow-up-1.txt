Subject: Just circling back, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to gently follow up in case my earlier message got buried — I know how full life can be.

I'm still holding space for a real, heart-centered chat about what it's really like being a high-performing woman in today's world — the unspoken pressure, the inner juggling, and the longing for a softer, more sustainable way.

If you're open to sharing your story, I'd love to hear it. You can pick a time that works best for you here:

Subject: Connect for a Heart-Centered Conversation

Hi [First Name],

I came across your LinkedIn profile while exploring women working in tech — and it's clear from your journey that you've carved out an inspiring path in a demanding field.

I'm Shilpa, founder of a holistic wellness company based in the SF Bay Area. I'm currently working on a passion project that involves interviewing high-achieving women like you to have real, honest conversations around:

* The weight of constantly being 'on' — for work, for family, for everything
* The mental and emotional juggling act behind high performance  
* The invisible toll success can take on our health, joy, and relationships

There's no pitch or hidden agenda — just a genuine, heart-centered conversation between two women who've lived this and are exploring what a more sustainable version of success looks like.

If this speaks to you, I'd love to connect and hear your story. You can book a time that works for you here:

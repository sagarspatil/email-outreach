Subject: Quick question from another woman in tech, {{FirstName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

I came across you while searching for women who code, ship, and still try to have a life. Your journey stood out.

I'm Shilpa, founder of Advaya Wellness in the Bay Area. I'm chatting with 50 women in tech about the hidden price of always being "on" and how we might reshape success in a more sustainable way so it doesn't cost our health and wellbeing.

Could we talk for 20 minutes? I simply want to listen to:

• The hardest part of keeping up the pace.

• Where burnout shows up first (mind, body, relationships)

• What support would make high-performance feel sustainable


If that resonates, grab any slot that works for you: https://calendly.com/advayaholistic-9quk/30min?month=2025-05

Thank you for considering it, and whether we talk or not, keep shining.

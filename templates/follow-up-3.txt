Subject: Final note â€” in case it's been on your mind

Hi [First Name],

Just dropping one last note in case this conversation has been tugging at you but timing hasn't quite lined up.

I'm wrapping up this round of interviews soon, but I'd still love to connect if you're feeling called. Your story could shine light on a path that so many high-achieving women are quietly walking.

If it resonates, here's the link one last time to book a spot:

Either way, thank you for the work you do and the energy you bring to the world.

Warmest wishes,

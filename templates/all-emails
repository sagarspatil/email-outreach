Email 1 – Initial Invitation
Subject: Quick question from another woman in tech, {{FirstName}}
Hi {{FirstName}},
I came across you while searching for women who code, ship, and still try to have a life. Your journey stood out.
I’m Shilpa, founder of Advaya Wellness in the Bay Area. I’m chatting with 50 women in tech about the hidden price of always being “on” and how we might reshape success in a more sustainable way so it doesn’t cost our health and wellbeing.
Could we talk for 20 minutes? I simply want to listen to:
The hardest part of keeping up the pace. 

Where burnout shows up first (mind, body, relationships)

What support would make high-performance feel sustainable


If that resonates, grab any slot that works for you: Schedule our Conversation
Thank you for considering it, and whether we talk or not, keep shining.

Email 3 – Reinforce Value (send 4–5 days after Email 2)
Subject: Your experience could guide other women, {{FirstName}}
Hi {{FirstName}},
The conversations so far have been eye-opening-patterns of quiet exhaustion and creative ways women are reclaiming space for themselves. Your voice would add something unique.
It’s a relaxed, off-the-record chat. If you’re open, choose a slot that fits: Reserve here
Thanks for considering.

Subject: Coffee on me, {{FirstName}} — did you see this?

Hi {{FirstName}},

I know your inbox is probably a whirlwind (mine too!). I’m following up on a note I sent a few days ago — I’m reaching out to women in tech who lead, code, ship, and still try to have a life.

I’m gathering real, honest stories about resilience, stress and what balance actually looks like behind the scenes.
If this resonates, I’d be so grateful to hear your perspective. You can pick a time that works for you here: Schedule our Conversation and in exchange for your time, I’d love to offer you coffee.

If now’s not the time, no worries at all — just wanted to make sure this didn’t get buried.

Warmly,
Shilpa Patil
